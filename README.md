# Rick and Morty Catalog

## Description
* "Rick and Morty Catalog" consists in a simple application with a list of the Rick And Morty TV show characters and detailed information about each one.
* Upon selection of a character, the users are sent to a detailed view that contains a character avatar, its name, location of origin among other data provided by the API.
* If users want to save a character card, a "Favorite" button is tapped and the character is saved on the "Favorites" tab.
* The Favorites tab contains all the characters a user has saved as favorite, ordered by ID.
* The settings tab contains a "Delete all" button that clears all Favorite characters, emptying the "Favorites" tab.
